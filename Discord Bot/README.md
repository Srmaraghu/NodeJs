Discord Bot Setup Guide
Introduction
This project features a Discord bot designed to provide two main functionalities:

URL Shortening: The bot can create shortened URLs for any given links. Users can generate a short URL which, when accessed, will redirect to the original URL. This feature is useful for sharing lengthy links in a more compact form. The shortened URL will be available in the format: http://localhost:{port}/shortUrl.

Interactive Q&A: The bot can answer user questions by leveraging the Gemini API. Users can ask the bot any question using the format ask {any question}, and the bot will respond with relevant answers generated by the Gemini API.

Setting Up a Discord Server
Step 1: Sign Up for Discord
Go to Discord Website:

Open your web browser and navigate to discord.com.
Create an Account:

You can use Discord directly in your browser or download the desktop app. The app is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Login:

After verifying your account, log in with your email and password.
Step 2: Create a New Server
Access the Discord Dashboard:

Once logged in, you’ll be on the main dashboard. On the left sidebar, you’ll see a list of servers.
Create Server:

Click on the "+" icon on the left sidebar under your server list.
A window will pop up asking if you want to “Create My Own” server or use a template. Select “Create My Own.”
Server Settings:

Choose whether the server is for “Me and my friends” or for a “Club or community.”
Name your server and choose a server region.
Click “Create” to finish the setup.
Invite Friends (Optional):

You can invite friends to your server by clicking the “Invite your friends” button. If you’re setting up a bot, you can skip this step for now.
Setting Up a Bot in the Discord Developer Portal
Step 3: Access the Discord Developer Portal
Open Developer Portal:

Go to the Discord Developer Portal in your browser.
Login:

If you’re not already logged in, use your Discord account credentials to log in.
Step 4: Create a New Application
Start a New Application:

Once in the Developer Portal, click on New Application in the top right corner.
A form will appear. Enter the name of your application (this will be visible when people interact with your bot).
Click Create.
Application Settings:

Optionally, add a description to explain what your bot does.
Save changes by clicking the Save Changes button.
Step 5: Generate a Bot
Navigate to the Bot Section:

In your application dashboard, on the left sidebar, click on Bot.
Create a Bot:

Click on the Add Bot button.
Confirm by clicking Yes, do it! in the confirmation window.
Name Your Bot:

Customize your bot’s name and avatar.
Copy the bot’s token (a string of characters) from the TOKEN section. Important: This token is confidential; don’t share it.
Step 6: Configure Bot Permissions
Set Admin Permissions (Optional):

If you want your bot to have full administrative control over the server, toggle the Administrator permission on.
Set Custom Permissions:

Manually select specific permissions, such as managing messages, reading message history, or connecting to voice channels.
Save changes after adjusting any settings.
Step 7: Generate OAuth2 URL and Invite the Bot
Navigate to OAuth2 Tab:

On the left sidebar of your application dashboard, click on OAuth2.
Generate OAuth2 URL:

Scroll down to the OAuth2 URL Generator section.
Under SCOPES, select bot.
Under BOT PERMISSIONS, select the permissions you want the bot to have.
Generate the URL:

Copy the generated URL and paste it into your browser’s address bar.
Invite the Bot to Your Server:

Select your server from the dropdown list and click Authorize.
Complete the CAPTCHA if prompted.
Running the Node.js Application
Step 8: Create a Project Directory
Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, etc.):
Create a new directory for your bot and navigate into it:
bash
Copy code
mkdir discord-bot
cd discord-bot
Step 9: Initialize a Node.js Project
Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:

bash
Copy code
npm init
Install Dependencies:

Manually install dependencies like discord.js and any other required modules (since Node.js projects don't typically use requirements.txt).
bash
Copy code
npm install discord.js dotenv
Step 10: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in your project directory:

Add your bot token and any other secrets to this file:
bash
Copy code
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
Load environment variables in your Node.js script:

Ensure you load your .env file in your code by adding this line at the top of your script:
js
Copy code
require('dotenv').config();
Step 11: Start the Bot
Use the following command to start your bot:

bash
Copy code
node your-bot-file.js
Test the Bot:

Type /create {with_some_url} in your server to see if the bot responds with a shortened URL.
Type ask {any question} in your server to see if the bot responds with an answer from the Gemini API.
