Project Setup Instructions
Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to set up the project and run your JavaScript files.

1. Initialize the Project
First, you need to initialize a new Node.js project. This will create a package.json file, which is essential for managing your project's dependencies and scripts.

bash
Copy code
npm init
During this step, you'll be prompted to answer a series of questions about your project (e.g., name, version, description). You can either fill these out or press Enter to use the default values. This will generate a package.json file in your project directory.

2. Install Express
Next, you'll need to install Express, a popular web framework for Node.js. This step is necessary if your project involves creating a web server or handling HTTP requests.

bash
Copy code
npm i express
This command installs the express package and adds it as a dependency in your package.json file.

3. Running Your JavaScript Files
Once the setup is complete, you can run your JavaScript files using Node.js. Use the following command, replacing filename.js with the name of the file you want to execute:

bash
Copy code
node filename.js
Make sure to replace filename.js with the actual name of the JavaScript file you intend to run.

Additional Information
package.json: This file contains metadata about your project and lists all the dependencies that your project requires. It’s automatically created when you run npm init.

node_modules/: This directory contains all the installed packages and their dependencies. It’s automatically created when you run npm install.
